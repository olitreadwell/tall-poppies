# 🦒 Tall Poppies Pōneke

[![CI](https://github.com/olitreadwell/tall-poppies-ponke-nz/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/olitreadwell/tall-poppies-ponke-nz/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

*Standing tall in Pōneke.*

A community-driven meetup group for tall people in Wellington, NZ. No
ducking, no craning, no "how's the weather up there?" — just honest,
matey socials at venues with actual headroom.

Built on [olitreadwell/template](https://github.com/olitreadwell/template):
quality gates, CI, and docs wired in from day one.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose | CI gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pnpm run dev` | Dev server | |
| `pnpm run build` | Production build | Blocking |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` | Blocking |
| `pnpm run lint` | ESLint | Blocking |
| `pnpm run format:check` | Prettier check | Blocking |
| `pnpm test` | Vitest unit/component | Blocking |
| `pnpm run test:coverage` | Coverage gate | Blocking |
| `pnpm run test:e2e` | Playwright | Blocking |
| `pnpm run test:a11y` | axe route audit (WCAG 2.2 A/AA) | Blocking (in e2e) |
| `pnpm run perf` | Lighthouse budgets (local) | Blocking |
| `pnpm run smoke` | Boot + curl routes | Blocking |
| `pnpm run check:links` | Internal link integrity | Blocking |
| **`pnpm run check`** | All of the above | Mirrored 1:1 |
| `pnpm run audit` | Dependency audit | Advisory |

## Quality gates (CI)

- **CI** — `pnpm run check` mirrored 1:1 (format, lint, typecheck,
  coverage, setup, build, smoke, e2e incl. axe, links).
- **Code review** — `alibaba/open-code-review` on every PR (deterministic
  rules; LLM-assisted when `LLM_API_KEY` is set). See
  [docs/audits.md](docs/audits.md).
- **Security** — blocking `pnpm audit` (high/critical) + committed-secret
  scan. See [docs/contributing/06-security.md](docs/contributing/06-security.md).
- **Quality** — Lighthouse budgets (a11y ≥ 0.95, perf/SEO ≥ 0.90,
  best-practices ≥ 0.95, FCP/LCP/TBT/CLS budgets) via
  `treosh/lighthouse-ci-action`.
- **Accessibility** — axe on every route (A/AA + best practice) in e2e,
  plus a documented manual AAA pass in [docs/a11y.md](docs/a11y.md).
- **Cost & speed** — path-aware triggers, `[skip ci]` token, in-flight
  cancellation, Docker layer caching, sharded e2e, 3-day artifact
  retention, local pre-push audit. See
  [docs/ci-optimization.md](docs/ci-optimization.md).

## Contact, feedback, help

- [Help center / FAQ](/help) — answers, plus how to reach a human
- [Contact](/contact) — validated, rate-limited form to the project inbox
- [Report feedback](/feedback) — files a labelled GitHub issue with full
  context (browser, page, repro steps)

Abuse protection (proof of work + per-IP rate limit + honeypot) is on by
default. The contract is documented in [docs/contact.md](docs/contact.md)
and published machine-readably at `/.well-known/feedback.json`.

## Tech stack

- Next.js App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict
- Tailwind CSS 4 + Radix UI primitives in `src/components/ui`
- Vitest + Testing Library + vitest-axe; Playwright e2e
- pnpm (lockfile committed, frozen installs in CI); ESLint 9 flat config +
  Prettier; husky pre-commit/pre-push
- Zod validation at the boundary, pino structured logs, centralized errors
- Multi-stage Dockerfile with `HEALTHCHECK` on `/health`

## Agent-first repo

`AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` tell AI agents exactly how this repo works, what
the quality bar is, and how to verify changes. See
[docs/llm-agent-optimization.md](docs/llm-agent-optimization.md) for why the
repo is written the way it is.
